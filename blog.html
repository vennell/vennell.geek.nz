	<h2>Ben Vennell</h2>
	
	<h4>First about me post!</h4>
	<p>Hello everyone, my name is Ben Vennell and I am a Geek.</p>
	<p>Together with the support of my wife, Erin, and our son, Alex, I have been able to channel this crippling affliction into a useful skill. In recent years I have managed to not completely brake down every computer in the house every month, I am yet to wire the TV to the microwave or spend our grocery budget on a new mouse. My wife has even had a functioning laptop for more than a year straight!</p>
	<p>Unfortunately for that to continue I need a release. For the past few years I have found a substitute to spending my money on new toys and systems, I now spend other peoples and in the process get them the new gadgets that I can no longer trust myself with.
	<h4>Technical Experience</h4>
	<p>I bought my first computer when I moved out of home in 2004. Since then I have invested hundreds of hours in learning how they operate and what it is possible to do with them. After several years of following this hobby I made it my career.
	<p>Since 2008 I have been working as a Desktop Administrator for one of the top 10 trusted brands in New Zealand. My primary responsibility has been the configuration and maintenance of all desktops, laptop, tablets and smart phones within the organisation. My roll also requires investigation of new technologies, assessment and integration into our environment.</p>
	<h4>After Hours Tech</h4>
	<p>One of my hobbies is gaming. Playing games may be relaxing for the gamer but it is the most stressful thing a computer is ever likely to do. In order to do it well it needs to be finely balanced and built to cope. I have been building my own gaming computers since 2004 and still enjoy the challenge of making console gamers jealous at every opportunity.</p>
	<p>In more recent years my attention has also been turned to home theatre and media centre computers. Building a media PC has opened up a whole new set of challenges, remote control, power consumption, image quality and noise reduction are an interesting counter point to the raw power of a gaming computer.</p>
